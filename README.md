This is the source of the web app that is served as a webview in AQUA Wallet to enable Reverse Submarine Swaps and Submarine Swap refunds.

This is a fork from [boltz-web-app](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-web-app) and used with permission from [boltz.exchange](https://boltz.exchange/).

For more details around licenseing and setup, please see [boltz-web-app](https://github.com/BoltzExchange/boltz-web-app).

*NOTE*: AQUA Wallet will be soon moving into a model where these functions are done natively in the app at which point this repo will be deprecated.
